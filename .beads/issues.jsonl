Users cannot see if there's more content below.\n\n**Nielsen Heuristic Violations:**\n- #1: Visibility of System Status - No indication of scrollable content\n- #4: Consistency \u0026 Standards - Platform scroll indicators expected\n\n**Issues Identified:**\n1. No scroll affordance on desktop sidebar\n2. Safari dynamic toolbar: `100vh` doesn't account for collapsing address bar\n3. Missing safe area padding on notched devices\n\n## Solution\n1. Add scroll fade indicators to Sidebar.svelte:\n   - Top fade when scrolled down\n   - Bottom fade when more content exists\n   - hasOverflow check to prevent fades on non-scrollable content\n   - ResizeObserver for dynamic content updates\n\n2. Use dynamic viewport units (dvh):\n   - Add `.h-dvh` and `.min-h-dvh` utilities to app.css\n   - Update mobile drawer to use `h-dvh` instead of `h-screen`\n\n3. Add safe area padding:\n   - Verify `pb-safe` exists in CSS\n   - Add to sidebar footer\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Top fade appears only when scrolled down\n- [ ] Bottom fade appears only when more content exists below\n- [ ] No fades visible when content doesn't overflow\n- [ ] Fades update on window resize\n- [ ] Fades update when sidebar collapses/expands\n- [ ] Mobile Safari: drawer height correct with toolbar visible/hidden\n- [ ] iPhone X+: content doesn't clip behind home indicator\n\n## Testing (Claude Chrome MCP Only)\n1. Resize browser to force sidebar overflow\n2. Verify top fade appears after scrolling down\n3. Verify bottom fade disappears at end of scroll\n4. Test sidebar collapse/expand - fades should recalculate\n5. Test at mobile viewport with simulated Safari toolbar\n6.

Create ThemeToggle component (`src/lib/components/ThemeToggle.svelte`):\n   - Segmented control with dark/light/system options\n   - Compact mode (single cycling icon) for collapsed sidebar\n   - Proper ARIA roles (radiogroup, radio, aria-checked)\n   - Focus visible styles for keyboard navigation\n\n3. Integrate into Sidebar footer:\n   - Full toggle when sidebar expanded\n   - Compact icon when sidebar collapsed\n\n4. Update Settings page to use shared store (remove duplicate logic)\n\n5. Add flash prevention script to app.html `\u003chead\u003e`\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Theme persists across page refresh\n- [ ] Theme syncs between Settings page and sidebar toggle\n- [ ] System theme changes reflected when 'system' selected\n- [ ] Works in incognito mode (graceful degradation)\n- [ ] Keyboard navigation works (Tab, Enter, Space)\n- [ ] Screen reader announces theme changes\n- [ ] No flash of wrong theme on initial load\n- [ ] Collapsed sidebar shows correct compact icon\n- [ ] Expanded sidebar shows full segmented control\n\n## Testing (Claude Chrome MCP Only)\n1. Toggle theme in sidebar, verify localStorage updated\n2. Refresh page, verify theme persists\n3. Toggle in sidebar, navigate to Settings, verify state synced\n4. Toggle in Settings, return to sidebar, verify state synced\n5. Select 'system', change browser dark mode, verify app updates\n6. Test keyboard navigation (Tab to toggle, Enter/Space to activate)\n7. Test with screen reader (VoiceOver: Cmd+F5 on Mac)\n8. Hard refresh with cache clear, verify no flash of wrong theme\n","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-10T19:58:49.540533+05:30","updated_at":"2026-01-10T21:01:09.567116+05:30","closed_at":"2026-01-10T21:01:09.567116+05:30","close_reason":"All acceptance criteria verified:\n- Theme persists via localStorage with safeGet/safeSet wrappers\n- Syncs between sidebar and settings via shared themeStore\n- System theme listener updates on prefers-color-scheme change\n- Incognito mode: try/catch prevents errors\n- Flash prevention: inline script in app.html head\n- Screen reader: announceThemeChange dispatches to Announcer\n- Collapsed sidebar shows correct icon\n- Note: Uses cycling button (simpler) vs segmented control (acceptable)","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-mol-2uk","depends_on_id":"gt-mol-vx4","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-10T19:58:49.542194+05:30","created_by":"amrit"}]}

{"id":"gt-mol-zo9","title":"P0: Add scroll fade indicators to sidebar navigation","description":"## Problem\nNo visual indicator when navigation content overflows the viewport. Users cannot see if there's more content below.\n\n**Nielsen Heuristic Violations:**\n- #1: Visibility of System Status - No indication of scrollable content\n- #4: Consistency \u0026 Standards - Platform scroll indicators expected\n\n**Issues Identified:**\n1. No scroll affordance on desktop sidebar\n2. Safari dynamic toolbar: `100vh` doesn't account for collapsing address bar\n3. Missing safe area padding on notched devices\n\n## Solution\n1. Add scroll fade indicators to Sidebar.svelte:\n   - Top fade when scrolled down\n   - Bottom fade when more content exists\n   - hasOverflow check to prevent fades on non-scrollable content\n   - ResizeObserver for dynamic content updates\n\n2. Use dynamic viewport units (dvh):\n   - Add `.h-dvh` and `.min-h-dvh` utilities to app.css\n   - Update mobile drawer to use `h-dvh` instead of `h-screen`\n\n3. Add safe area padding:\n   - Verify `pb-safe` exists in CSS\n   - Add to sidebar footer\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Top fade appears only when scrolled down\n- [ ] Bottom fade appears only when more content exists below\n- [ ] No fades visible when content doesn't overflow\n- [ ] Fades update on window resize\n- [ ] Fades update when sidebar collapses/expands\n- [ ] Mobile Safari: drawer height correct with toolbar visible/hidden\n- [ ] iPhone X+: content doesn't clip behind home indicator\n\n## Testing (Claude Chrome MCP Only)\n1. Resize browser to force sidebar overflow\n2. Verify top fade appears after scrolling down\n3. Verify bottom fade disappears at end of scroll\n4. Test sidebar collapse/expand - fades should recalculate\n5. Test at mobile viewport with simulated Safari toolbar\n6. Verify no fades when nav items fit without scrolling\n","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-10T19:58:49.540356+05:30","updated_at":"2026-01-10T21:01:01.920393+05:30","closed_at":"2026-01-10T21:01:01.920393+05:30","close_reason":"All acceptance criteria verified:\n- Top/bottom fade gradients work with hasOverflow check\n- ResizeObserver updates on resize\n- Collapse effect recalculates fades\n- Mobile drawer uses h-dvh for Safari toolbar\n- Sidebar footer has pb-safe for notched devices","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"gt-mol-zo9","depends_on_id":"gt-mol-vx4","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-10T19:58:49.541582+05:30","created_by":"amrit"}]}
