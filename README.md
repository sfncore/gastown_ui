## Development Workflow

- Create a branch for each task.
- Keep changes scoped; update or add tests where applicable.
- Prefer reusable components in `src/lib/components`.
- Use semantic tokens from `src/app.css` and `tailwind.config.js`.

## Deployment

This is a standard SvelteKit/Vite build. Use your hosting provider’s static
or node adapter flow as appropriate. The build output is generated by
`bun run build`.

## Contribution

- Keep commit messages concise.
- Avoid introducing new deps unless necessary.
- Maintain accessibility and keyboard support on interactive views.
- Follow the testing policy below.

## Testing Policy (Non-Negotiable)
