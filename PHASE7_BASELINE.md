# Phase 7 Baseline Analysis - Performance Metrics

**Date**: January 10, 2026  
**Status**: Baseline Established  
**Build Time**: 9.56 seconds

## Bundle Analysis Results

### JavaScript Chunks (Unminified)

**Total JS (chunks/): 355,479 bytes (unminified)**

Largest chunks:
1. `D4opDtL5.js` - 176 KB (app layout bundle)
   - Gzipped: 34.15 KB ✅
2. `DmkJuAE0.js` - 52 KB (likely lucide-svelte icons)
   - Gzipped: ~13 KB
3. `DOR9aLX-.js` - 44 KB
   - Gzipped: ~11 KB
4. `BVKW2ClN.js` - 40 KB
   - Gzipped: ~15 KB

**Key Finding**: Single large main bundle (D4opDtL5.js) indicates code is not yet split by route. This is the primary optimization opportunity.

### CSS Bundles

**Total CSS: 92 KB (unminified)**

Main CSS:
- `0.BiIJfz0O.css` - 88 KB (unminified)
  - Gzipped: 14.58 KB ✅
- `ErrorState.DS9oW2MX.css` - 4 KB
  - Gzipped: ~1 KB

**Analysis**: CSS production file is 88KB uncompressed, 14.58KB gzipped. Within acceptable range. Tailwind purging is working.

### Current Total Bundle (Gzipped)

```
JavaScript:     ~63 KB (estimated from largest chunks)
CSS:            14.58 KB
Total:          ~77.58 KB (gzipped)
```

**Baseline (estimated for all assets)**:
- Main JS: 63 KB (gzipped)
- CSS: 14.58 KB (gzipped)
- Other assets: ~10 KB
- **Total Estimated: ~87-100 KB (gzipped)**

### Build Output Structure

```
build/
├── _app/
│   ├── immutable/
│   │   ├── chunks/      (356 KB total JS)
│   │   └── assets/      (92 KB total CSS)
│   └── version.json
├── index.html           (2.3 KB, precompressed)
└── [static assets]      (icons, manifest, etc.)
```

**Key Observation**: SvelteKit is already generating separate route bundles, but they're being combined into larger chunks during the build. The code splitting infrastructure exists—we need to verify it's optimized.

## Current Performance Metrics (Estimated)

Based on bundle analysis:

| Metric | Current | Target | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Main JS (gzipped)** | ~63 KB | <50 KB | ⚠️ OPTIMIZE |
| **CSS (gzipped)** | 14.58 KB | <15 KB | ✅ GOOD |
| **Total (gzipped)** | ~77.58 KB | <70 KB | ⚠️ OPTIMIZE |
| **Build Time** | 9.56s | <10s | ✅ GOOD |
| **TypeScript Errors** | 0 | 0 | ✅ GOOD |

## Optimization Opportunities

### 1. JavaScript Bundle Splitting

**Current State**: One large main bundle (176 KB uncompressed, 34.15 KB gzipped)

**Opportunity**: 
- D4opDtL5.js contains layout + all routes
- Can split into route-specific bundles
- Expected reduction: 20-30% via lazy route loading

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Verify SvelteKit route splitting configuration
- [ ] Implement route-based code splitting (if not auto)
- [ ] Lazy-load heavy routes (work, agents, settings, seance)
- [ ] Measure impact after splitting

**Expected Outcome**: Main bundle 40-50 KB gzipped, route bundles 10-20 KB each

### 2. Dependency Analysis

**lucide-svelte (52 KB uncompressed)**:
- ~13 KB gzipped
- Used across all pages
- Consider: tree-shaking icons, dynamic imports for heavy pages

**Tailwind CSS (included in main CSS)**:
- Already optimized with purging
- 14.58 KB gzipped is good

**Other bundled dependencies**:
- zod (~10 KB)
- tailwind-merge/variants
- dompurify
- clsx

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Verify icon imports are tree-shaken
- [ ] Check for duplicate bundled code
- [ ] Review dependency bundle contributions

### 3. Route-Level Optimization

**Large routes identified**:
- Work page (35KB server chunk) - Complex forms, validation
- Settings page (34KB server chunk) - Multiple form sections
- Mail page (22KB server chunk) - Split-view layout
- Seance page (22KB server chunk) - Complex layout

**Optimization Strategy**:
- Lazy-load form components for above routes
- Defer non-critical modal components
- Use dynamic imports for heavy utilities

**Expected Outcome**: 5-10% reduction in main bundle

### 4. CSS Further Optimization

**Current**: 14.58 KB gzipped (good)

**Possible optimizations**:
- Remove unused CSS classes (unlikely, Tailwind purging is working)
- Minify variable definitions
- Consider CSS splitting for above-fold critical CSS

**Expected Impact**: Minimal (CSS already optimized)

## Lighthouse Baseline

**To be measured after bundle optimization.**

Current estimate based on bundle size:
- Performance: 85-90 (good)
- LCP: 2.0-2.5s (good)
- FID: <100ms (good)
- CLS: <0.1 (good)

---

## Next Steps

### Phase 7.1.1: Code Splitting (Immediate)
1. Verify SvelteKit route splitting is enabled
2. Test in DevTools Network tab
3. Document actual bundle sizes per route
4. Implement lazy loading for heavy routes if needed

### Phase 7.1.2: Bundle Optimization
1. Review lucide-svelte imports
2. Check for tree-shaking effectiveness
3. Test dynamic imports for modal components

### Phase 7.1.3: Core Web Vitals Measurement
1. Run Lighthouse audit (mobile + desktop)
2. Test on real device with 3G throttle
3. Measure LCP, FID, CLS directly
4. Compare with baseline

### Phase 7.1.4: Image Optimization
1. Audit static/ directory for images
2. Convert to WebP where applicable
3. Generate responsive variants
4. Implement lazy loading
